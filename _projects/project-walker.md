Project Walker transforms Minecraft into an immersive post-apocalyptic survival experience. In this harsh new world,
players must carefully scavenge for resources while navigating the constant threats of the undead, hostile survivors,
and the elements. The addon introduces an expansive arsenal of weapons including firearms and melee weapons, along
with crucial survival items like medical supplies, food, and drink. New gameplay mechanics such as infection risk,
bleeding damage, bone fractures, and temperature management create a deeply strategic survival experience. Custom
blocks, hostile mobs, and detailed environments complete the atmospheric transformation of the vanilla Minecraft
world into a challenging post-apocalyptic wasteland.
