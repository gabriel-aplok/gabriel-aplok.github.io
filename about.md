    			Hi, I’m <strong>Gabriel Lima</strong> (also known as Gabriel Aplok)—a passionate full-stack developer, game creator, and Minecraft modder. As the CEO and founder of <strong>FireWave Interactive</strong>, I lead teams to deliver innovative, high-quality digital experiences.

Since 2018, I’ve built a diverse portfolio in web and mobile development, spanning front-end, back-end, and UX/UI design. I currently contribute to both FireWave Interactive and Kolpa Technologies, focusing on memorable, impactful projects.
